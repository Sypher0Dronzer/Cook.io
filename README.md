## Introduction

cook.io is a recipe website that leverages the power of the Edamam Recipe API to provide users with a wide range of delicious recipes from around the world.

## API Usage

cook.io utilizes the Edamam Recipe API to fetch recipe data. It's important to note that there is a limitation to the API usage: not more than 10 calls/requests can be sent within a minute. As a result, users may experience a short delay when accessing certain features of the website.
